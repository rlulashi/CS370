# CS370




Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

# We were given a template for the Treasure Maze where we were tasked to develop the learning algorithm. Treasure Maze and 
# Game Experience were already completed and we had the pseudocode for the Main file. The task was to implement learning 
# for an agent pirate that was to achieve a 100% win rate against a player. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
# Computer Scientists use logic and mathematics to deduce and solve problems that can range from many fields.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
# I tend to make sure I fully comprehend the task at hand and read all required material. From there I make a 
# list of requirements and check off each portion as it meets said requirements. I do apply this type of thinking
# in my daily operations and it may take a bit longer but allows for smoother flow of work. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
# Making sure that data is only used where needed and not misused. Delivering a good product that meets all 
# requirements without compromising quality. Projects can be rushed due to deadlines, however it is imperative
# that quality is of the highest. It is better to under promise and over deliver!
